but what if I told you this?
what if i told you that out attachment to being good people is getting in the way of（阻碍） us being better people?
what id I tole you that out definition of "good person" is so narrow,
it's scientifically impossible to meet?
and what if I told you the path to being better people just begins with letting go（放弃） of being a good person?

now let me tell you a little bit about the research about how the human mind works to explain.
the brain relies on shortcuts（捷径） to do a lot of its work.
that means a lot of the time, your metal processes are taking place outside of your awareness（意识之外）,
like in low-battery, low-power mode in the back of your mind.
that's, in fact, the premise（前提） of 'bounded rationality'(有限理性).
