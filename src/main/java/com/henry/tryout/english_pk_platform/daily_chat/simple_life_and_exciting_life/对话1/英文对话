JJ: Ah, another beautiful day, isn't it? What's the “game plan”（行动计划） for today?
XG: I dunno, I'll probably just sit at home and read a book.
JJ: Read a book? On such perfect day? Geez, your life seems a little “dull”（沉闷无趣的）, don't you think?
XG: Yeah, maybe, but I like “leading my simple life”（过一种简单的生活）. It's safe, easy and predictable.
I'm not one of those people that likes “living on the edge”（过疯狂的生活）.
JJ: Oh, come on！“Live a little”（活得有点滋味嘛）, will ya?
XG: Well, what do you suggest I do in order to make my life more interesting?
JJ: Hey, how about you and I go... Oh, what's that word?
It's “on the tip of my tongue”（话到嘴边，忘词了）. It's where you can “glide down”（滑下） a hill or a mountain
with special wings on your back.
XG: You mean “hang gliding”（滑翔翼）? I don't know... I don't think I “have the wits”（有勇气） to do that.
It seems a little dangerous.
JJ: I tell you what. I'll “look into”（调查） it for us. Just promise me that you'll do it?
Don't “wimp out”（害怕而退缩）, okay?
XG: Okay, okay. I'll do it.
JJ: Yes! This is gonna be awesome（很棒）!
