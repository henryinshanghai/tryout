jing: mark, it's only a few days away from May holiday. are you ready for it?
mark: yes and no. works always like 'very busy-less busy-very busy' cycle.
jing: so what? don't you want to get off of work, and take a pure break?
mark: it's a great timing to catch up some paper work.

mark: anyway, I think procrastination can help me avoid burnout.
jing: I think that's bogus. but that remind me, I find out 6 approach
to make people burnout.
mark: wow, should I take a note?
jing: they are basically common sense. I read them from an internet article.
and one of them is doing the wrong job.
mark: I have a friend once hated his job.
when I get to see him again, he went to another company, and looked younger.
jing: we all know some people like him.
but to most of us, even if we are doing not so boring or even satisfying job.
there's still another approach to make us burnout at work.
mark: work too many hours?
jing: you guess it right. it gotta be one of the reasons. right?
the article mentioned that burnout has something to do with not having enough rest.
mark: yeah, people've been glue around their desk.
the offices can be tedious and the lift can be nasty.
jing: it'll totally worth it if you can go to a private corner
or somewhere you can chat, even if it could take 10 minutes walk.
most people get to work more effective after that.
but before you get your coffee, I'd share with you a much subtler question.
mark: i'm all ears.
jing: if you bottle your thoughts in.
it will for sure to make you feel upset, burnout even depressed.
