（Xiaogao and Jingjing are on their way back from a new restaurant they have just tried.）
JJ: Wow! That was one of the best restaurants I've ever been to（？）!
XG: Tell me about it（？）! My steak was cooked to perfection（？）.
JJ: Yeah, and my tuna fish salad was made just right. I'll definitely be going back again（？）!
XG: No doubt!! I thought the prices were reasonable.
JJ: I agree. The service was so good that I gave the waiter a pretty big tip.
XG: You and me both（？）! I gave him a 25% tip! It was well deserved!
JJ: Come on, let's go tell our friends about this great place!
