XG: I must say, JJ. I have to ”take my hat off“（脱帽致敬） for you,
you said you'd be at my place at ”6:00 sharp“（6点整） and you were. I really appreciate it!
JJ: No problem, you know I always ”keep my word“（遵守承诺）. Well, right now it's only 07:00.
You still ”have some time to kill“（有空闲时间来消磨） before your plane leaves.
XG: Okay, let's go get a cup of coffee, it's my treat.
(XG says to the coffee shop worker) Two cup of coffee please.
JJ: Wow! This coffee is so ”strong“（浓郁的）, It just about ”knocked my socks off“（形容味道/气味很浓烈）!
I don't usually drink coffee this early in the morning.
XG: Yeah, this is some good stuff. You know, JJ, I'm really gonna miss you.
JJ: Now is not the time to ”get all emotional“（变得情绪激动）. Here, I brought you a going away gift.
XG: A gift? Why did you do that?
JJ: It's common for Chinese to give a gift when someone is coming or going. You didn't know?
XG: No, I didn't. That's so nice of you. Can I open it?
JJ: ”Be my guest“（请便）.
XG: Cool! A new watch! I needed a new one!
JJ: I'm glad you like it.
(The loud speaker at the airport says Now boarding flight 1423 to Detroit.)
XG: That's my flight. I gotta ”bounce“（离开）. Thanks for everything, JJ. I'll see you when I get back.
JJ: Take care, XG.
