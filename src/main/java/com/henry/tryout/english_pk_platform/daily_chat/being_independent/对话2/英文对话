JJ: XG, I've been knocking on your door for half an hour now, what's going on?
XG: Sorry, I was sleeping. I've been so tried lately.
JJ: ”Too much bed makes a dull head“（睡太多觉会让人懒惰）! You're really turning into a “slacker”（大懒虫）!
XG: Actually, I took your advice and got a part-time job.
I've been working the “graveyard shift”（夜班） and coming home really early every morning.
JJ: What about your classes? Are you “putting them on the back burner”（把某事放在次要位置）?
XG: No, school comes first.
I go to school in the evening then I go to work.
It's been really hard trying to be independent.
I didn't think it would be this much work.
JJ: “Be careful what you wish for”（当你得到你想要的东西时，还可能会引起一些你没有想到的问题）.
I never said being an independent person is easy.
Now you know how much pain your parents went through when they were raising you.
This is your first time living away from you parents and depending on yourself.
“You have to learn to walk before you can run”（循序渐进，一步步来）. Take it easy!
XG: Well, now that you're here, it'd be nice to go out and do something.
Let's go see a movie!
JJ: Okay, and now that you have some “pocket money”（零花钱）, I'll let you buy my ticket.
