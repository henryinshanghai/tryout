（JJ and XG are on the top of a big hill with hang gliding equipment. They begin their conversation）
XG: I can't believe we're actually doing this. This is crazy! “My heart's beating a million times a second”（我非常激动）.
JJ: Just whatever you do, don't “chicken out”（临阵退缩）. Otherwise we will have “come here in vain”（白白来到这儿）.
XG: Don't worry, I “made it this far”（都已经走到这一步了）. I'm not “backing out”（退出） now.
JJ: Good, it's time we “let our hair down”（放松） and have a good time.
After all, that's why we are here, aren't we? Okay, let's get our equipment ready now.
XG: Hey, “how come you get to”（凭什么是你可以做...） use the yellow wings? I wanted to use them.
JJ: Don't be a baby, the red ones you're using are just “as good looking”（一样好看）.
Come on, let's get ready to have some fun.
XG: Oh, JJ. I can't thank you enough for “dragging me out here”（把我拽到这儿来）.
I think this is gonna be “just what the doctor ordered”（我所需要的）.
JJ: Definitely, it's a good “stress reliever”（释放压力的方式）. Okay, “on the count of three”（我数三下）,
we're gonna “run off this hill”（跳下山去） together. Ready?
XG: Okay.
BOTH: 1-2-3 Wheeeeeee!
