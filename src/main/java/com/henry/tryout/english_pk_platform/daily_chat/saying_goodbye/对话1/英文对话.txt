XG: well, JJ, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ”cut my stay short“（早于预期停止做某事） here in BeiJing.
JJ: What? You mean you're gonna ”split“（离开）？Why? I thought you liked it here?
XG: Don't worry, I'll be back. I'm just going home to ”straighten out“（解决...问题） my visa.
JJ: Oh, okay, phew! Well, when are you coming back?
XG: Probably in a mouth or so. But I have to leave soon.
My visa expires in a couple of days so it's a ”race against the clock“（着急的事情） to get back home as soon as possible.
JJ: Oh, I see.
Well, when you come back hopefully you'll have “all the time in the world”（有大量的时间，不必着急）.
It's no fun being ”pressed for time“（时间紧迫）.
Hey, do you have anyone that will send you to the airport?
XG: No, I'm gonna take a cab there. Unless...
JJ: Of course I'll take you! You know you don't have to ask that!
XG: Really? You're the greatest!
JJ: I know I am! ”What time does your flight leave?“（固定问法：你的航班几点起飞?）
XG: Nine in the morning, do you think you can handle that?
JJ: I'll be at your place at 6:00 ”on the dot“（整点）. See you then!
XG: Okay, see ya!
