JJ: Hey, Xiaogao. My stomach's churning（？）. Let's go grab a bite to eat（？）.
XG: I'm down（？）. Where do you feel like going?（？）
JJ: Have you been to that new Italian restaurant down the street（？）?
I've been meaning to try it out（？）.
XG: Yeah, I have. It's horrible!
JJ: So you mean you wouldn't recommend it?
XG: Not in a million years!
JJ: Well, what was so wrong with the place?
XG: The food was a complete rip off（？）. I paid $34 for a hamburger and
a side of fries（？）. On top of that, the food is cold and the service was lousy（？）.
JJ: Thanks for the info. I guess we'll have to try another place then.
Come on, let's go take a walk and see what's new.
