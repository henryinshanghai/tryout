JJ and Mark are walking farther along the street after dinner.

JJ: you know, we still haven't found a good Italian restaurant in this neighborhood.

Mark: Well, there is one, but I found it to be(？) rather pricey（？）. Actually, that's it,
just across the street. Wanna go over and take a look?

JJ: Sure. What a cute little place.
Hey, there's a menu posted（？） at the door. And the prices are not too bad.

Mark: Yeah, for each item, it's within reason（？）. When I ate here, I had to order three
main dishes, because each one is pretty small. You kinda have to go all out（？）.

JJ: You mean just a pasta dish（？） wouldn't be enough for one person?

Mark: Not even close. You'll feel embarrassed ordering so little, and nowhere near（？） full afterward（？）.

JJ: Jey, the tiramisu is about the same price as anywhere else.

Mark: I could go for that（？） right now, and maybe an espresso.
