XG: I can't believe I'll be going to college next month.
It seems like just yesterday I was ”starting my freshmen year“（新入学） of high school.
JJ: That's great, but what are you so ”pumped up“（激动） about? College is a lot of work, you know?
XG: Yeah, but now I'm finally free! I'm gonna move into my own ”dorm room“（宿舍）! Now no one can tell me what to do!
JJ: Your parents can still tell you what to do.
XG: What do you mean? I'm moving out of their house.
JJ: Just because you move out of their house, doesn't mean you're independent.
If they're paying your ”living expenses“（生活花费）
then ”technically“（严格来说） you still depend on them so you should still be respectful
and ”listen to what they have to say“（认真听他们要讲的话）.
XG: Yeah, I guess you're right. Why did you have to ”take the wind out of my sail“（浇灭某人激动的心）?
I was really getting excited.
JJ: If you want to depend on them less, then maybe you should get a part-time job once school starts.
XG: I'll consider it.
JJ: Hey, since you're moving out of your parents' house soon, do you wanna sell me your television that's in your room?
XG: ”Be my guest“（欢迎呀）. That thing is so old, I was gonna ”toss it out“（扔掉） anyway, you can just have it.
JJ: Really? Thanks!
XG: I'm glad you like it. Besides, ”one man's trash is another man's treasure“（一个人的垃圾可能是另一个人的财富）.
