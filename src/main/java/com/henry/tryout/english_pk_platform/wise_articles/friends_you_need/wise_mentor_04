Jesse Jackson once said, "Never look down on someone unless you're helping them up."
If you have someone smart, inspiring, and admirable in your life
who practices this philosophy, you're extremely lucky.
We all need a friend who inspires us to be better people without making us feel
inadequate.
Plus, being around such a person will challenges us to better ourselves
every day.

The wise mentor in your life doesn't have to be someone who shares the same
occupation or hobbies with you.
It's simply someone who's a few steps ahead of you in life
and has enough wisdom and patience to guide you in the right direction.
It can be anyone - a colleague, a friend who's beyond their years, or an older neighbor -
as long as you loop up to this person and wnat to be more like them.
