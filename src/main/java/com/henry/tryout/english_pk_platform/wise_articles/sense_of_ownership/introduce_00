why are we so attached to our things?

After witnessing the violent rage(狂怒) shown by babies whenever deprived of
an item they considered their own, Jean Piaget, a founding father of child psychology,
observed something profound（意义深远的） about human nature.
our sense of ownership emerges incredibly early.
why are we so clingy（过度依赖别人的）?

there's a well-established phenomenon in psychology known as the
endowment effect（禀赋效应） where we value items much more highly just as soon as we own them.
In one famous demonstration, students were given a choice between a coffee mug or
a Swiss chocolate bar as a reward（奖励） for helping out with research.
Half chose the mug, and has chose the chocolate.
that is, they seemed to value the two rewards similarly.
