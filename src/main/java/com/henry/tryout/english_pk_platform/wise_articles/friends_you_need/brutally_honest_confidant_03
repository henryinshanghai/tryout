there are certain situations in life where we need to hear the harsh truth.
that's what the brutally honest confidant is for.
If you are in a rocky relationship and everyone's telling you that it's
perfectly normal that you are back with that special someone for the 8th time
in the last 2 years,
the brutally honest confidant is there to yank(æ‹½) your rose-colored glasses off
and tell you, "Enough. Stop with all that break-up-and-get-back-together drama.
You deserve better."
Friends are supposed to be honest with each other.
If you find someone who is brutally honest with you(in a constructive way),
then hold on to this person!
people like that are hard to come by those days.
