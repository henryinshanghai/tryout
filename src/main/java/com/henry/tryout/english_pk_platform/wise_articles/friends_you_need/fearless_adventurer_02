we live in a big world where there are so many places to see, people to meet, and experiences to be had,
yet so many of us are stuck in our own routines and forget to, well, live.
We all need an adventurous friend who will pull us out of our shells and introduce us to new ideas,
cultures, philosophies, and activities.
