these days, a lot of people don't know their own neighbors.
it's a shame, because some neighbors can be the nicest and most helpful people ever.
if you're on a vacation, and you suddenly realize that you forgot to lock the front door,
you can call up your trusty ol' neighbor（信得过的邻居） and ask them to head over to your house and lock it for you.
Nice dependable neighbors who have each others' backs are a dying breed（罕见的一类人）,
but hat doesn't mean you shouldn't introduce yourself to the new neighbors across the street.
