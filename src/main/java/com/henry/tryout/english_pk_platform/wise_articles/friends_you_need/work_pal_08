Did you know that with a full-time job, you spend at least 50% of your waking hours at work?
Not only that, but you spend some more time commuting（通勤） to work, thinking about work, working overtime,
and furthering（拓展） your career on your personal time.
Depressing, isn't it?

Statistics show that the more isolated（孤立的） you are at work, the more depressed you get.
that‘s why it makes sense to get a work pal to chat with at the water cooler and to help
you get through the week.
you spend 50% of your waking hours at work, and so does your work pal.
You'll find it much easier to shoot the breeze（侃大山） and complain about work with someone
who can relate to you than eating lunch alone every day.

your work pal doesn't have to be your best friend outside of work.
they just need to be someone you click with on some level,
and if you two hit it off（合得来） exceptionally well, you can always start hanging out with them outside of the office.
