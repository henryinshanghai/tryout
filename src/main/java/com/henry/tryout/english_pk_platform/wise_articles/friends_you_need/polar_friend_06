we humans are hard-wired（硬编码的） to get together in groups and attack outsiders -
the human pack mentality（团队性思维）, if you will.
if you only develop friendships with others who follow the same beliefs, customs, and values
as you do, chances are you are somewhat detached（脱离） from the rest of the world,
and you're more likely to per`petuate（延续） stereotypes（成见） on anyone who holds a different world view from you.

Instead of constantly surrounding yourself with like-minded people,
try to break out of your comfort zone and befriend people who hold opposing views.
they will help open your eyes to different world views and you'll learn to accept
people who don't see the world exactly the way you see it.
