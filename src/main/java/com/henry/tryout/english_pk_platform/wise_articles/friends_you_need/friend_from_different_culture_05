the last thing you want to be described as is someone who's stuck in their own ways.
If everyone had a friend from a different culture, the world would be a much better place.
Being in a cross-culture friendship allows you to explore customs, values, and traditions
outside of your own culture.
Sometimes you might even adopt（采取，采用） new ways to do things.

Be careful; don't befriend someone just because they're from a different culture.
No one likes to be a token friend（象征性的朋友）.
Instead, keep your mind open, and if you come across someone you click with
who just so happens to be（刚巧） from a different culture, make the effort to learn about their customs,
values, and traditions while getting to know the person on a personal level.
