people have asked me what do I think of chatGPT.
am i excited?
well, as an scientist, i'm pretty interested in the technological breakthroughs.
as a human being i'm not excited.
and this video I'm going to tell you why.

fundamentally, my point is that a lot of these technologies feel to me
like an improved means to an unimproved end. (为了毫无改进的目标提供了改进的手段)
in another word, tools that get us faster to exactly where do we not want to go.
and the reason for that is because I believe the more powerful the technology,
the more developed we have to be, the more enlightened humanity has to be,
the more clear humanity to be about what constitute a good life.

if they are to be used for net aggregate good, and I do not believe humanity is in that spot.
so I believe that tools like AI and other associated technologies will just get us faster
to where do we not want to be.
nuclear technology is a parallel that  i'd use.
can be used for fantastic clean renewable energy source
or can be used to destroy the entire world, we did both.

Let me give you five points in particular, and they're gonna be in ascending order of importance(按照重要程度正序排列).
with point four and five being really for me the most core points.

but let's start with the first most obvious one that
you know it will cause a lot of disruption（颠覆） and these days in modern culture,
disruption is spoken of as if it is in and of itself(从内到外) a good thing.
but sometimes I think is a little bit like the english expression 'turkey voting for christmas.（火鸡给圣诞节投票）'
disruption is all very well until you are the one being disrupted.

I think we always have to accept that in disruption there's a lot of human miseries caused by it.
now you may say overall for society it is good,
but that doesn't mean i have to be excited about people losing their jobs.
and I do think there's huge potential for people to lose their jobs with this.
and not just the jobs that people that expected.
there are all people sitting out there, lawyers, financiers, doctors, writers creatives,
who would've thought that their job was pretty safe,
and it's not gonna be safe in the near future.
and that's tough psychologically（心理上地） on people.
you may not feel sympathetic about those people who hold these classically(光鲜的) quite good jobs.
but more or less it will cause a lot of human misery.
will more job been created? that's the usual argument.right
may, may not, that's why I reserve my opinion.
but the key is this, it's not just aggregate(净增长) jobs being created,
is meaningful jobs being created. will more enough meaningful jobs be created to replace?
the jury is out(情况尚不明朗) I think.

my second point related is who is gonna stand to benefit most（获利最多）.
I suspect it will be the owners of capital that invest behind these AI algorithms.
in other words, as usual, with a lot of techno`logical process,
it's likely to be rigged(垄断, 操纵) such that it benefits the one percent rather than ninety nine percent.
again you may say this is the price we pay to live in progress society comfortable etc etc.
but again, whether the benefits really aggregate(利大于弊)? the jury is out.
can i be excited today before I've seen actually how people will use it?
can i be excited today before I see whether it will benefit humanity as a whole
in particular those people who are struggling.
no I can't. because I haven't seen any evidence for that yet.
all i see is propositions(买点), a number of propositions such as the one above, removing jobs.
do not seem to me to be necessarily conducive（有利的） to aggregate human happiness.

my third point I guess is more in the way it operates.
the AI is not creative in a sense even though it can pretend to be creative.
you saw ChatGPT create poems and this and that.
but really what it's doing is it's sourcing its data sources, and aggregating together
stuff that people've already done.
in other words, it's a mass plagia`rism(抄袭) device,
which I guess in some sense is what a lot of research is or at least research that's textual
that's using other people's work.
but the problem with AI is that all it will do is continually reinforce biases and patterns
in its original data source.
it's only as good as its data source is what i'm saying.
so if you feed in a bunch of conspiracy theories, what comes out is a bunch of conspiracy theories.
if you feed in a bunch of inaccurate data, what comes out is inaccurate data.
what that means is that as AI create more of its own content, that is then used by other AI.
you get this self reinforcing cycle of nonsense where innate mistakes and inaccuracies biases,
unpleasant material gets reinforces and reinforced.
it's the classic echo chamber effect(回声房间).
so unless human beings intervene proactively to prevent that phenomena.
you could see much like（就像） they've seen a lot in america recently.
the echo chamber on stereo（音响）.

now to my fourth and fifth point, which for me  probably the most fundamental.
the previous three you've probably heard of before and I think they're fixable in certain ways.
create more jobs, sort out the plagia`rism stuff, etc, etc. distribute the wealth more evenly.
all of that can be sorted.
but the fourth and fifth to me are more fundamental.

the fourth point is, you know John Maynard Keynes he was a famous economist, many of you would've known.
he predicated that by now we would be barely working at all.
technology would be able to fulfill humanity's basic needs
and we could spend the rest of our time in leisure, socializing and creative pursuits,
and clearly, that hasn't been materialized. we're working harder than ever.
now why is that? there're a couple of points.
the first point is , because we are greedy.
those of us who could live more comfortable lives choose not to because we want to acquire more and more and
profit more and more.
technologies have been used to do that.
it's not being used to give us more free time, the efficiencies we save in technology
we are just plowing back（投入回去） into consumption.
now if you like I believe that consumption is not the unlocking key（钥匙） to human happiness.
that's not a positive trend.
in fact, the technology is being used to obscure(模糊) what truly makes us human,
is being used to cover up what can truly make us happy.
and that's what i mean by "a kind of faster route to misery".
if it just enables more consumption, more of the things that haven’t made us happy in the past.
aren't making us happy in the present, then it isn't a good thing,
and this is not a criticism of chatGPT, or any technology in and of itself,
because you can see that it can be used to achieve all those enlightened（有用的） ends（目标）.
the issue is, if you put it in the hands of a human being, who believe that the key to happiness
is more consumption. more environmental degra`dation, more exploi`tation, more competition or whatever.
then you end up in an unpleasant endpoint.

and that's my fifth point really, an increasing cyni`cism(愤世嫉俗) about how this will be used.
when it came out lots of people talk about what Elon Musk for example "goodbye homework", I think he tweeted.
and lots of people are using it for that kind of efficiency.
is that a good thing? goodbye homework, losing all of that.
because the fact is that as human beings, we get the most pleasure from doing tasks.
I've had said this before. sometimes you do stuff not because it's the most efficient way,
is because it allows you express your humanity, doing homework, doing research, reading books, doing the hard miles intellectually.
these are things that can and should be satisfying in and of itself.
and the more we just simply try and automate them away,
I worry the more we abstract(抽象) ourselves from what is is truly to be human.

does that lead to overall(整体的) happiness of the human race?
does that lead to meaning.
the other reason Keynes' hy`pothesis didn't come right about low hours in working weeks
is because many people find meaning from their jobs,
and you take it away, you take away their meaning in life, and meaning is very important.
and so again, it's not criticism about chatGPT per sa, technology is neutral, but how we're gonna use it.

so the overall messages I'm giving, I'm not against techno`logical progress,
I think it's interesting as a piece of science for sure, very exciting as a piece of science.
but technology and human development need to move in tandem(同时).
we nee to be enlightened human beings more as we progress out technology more.
the more powerful the technology, the more responsibility we have as humanity.
to have our heads in the right place and understand what it is that's going to lead to net human good
and personal satisfaction.
however I fear that currently on the human development side we're going backwards,
and technology we are going forwards.
and in the end, that just leads us an accelerating course towards more misery.
