what do you want, Richard?

Bryce, I wanted to swing by and apologize for yelling at you when you offered your very unso`licited(不请自来的) opinion.
Also, on behalf of Jared, we mean no disrespect to you or your career choice. Okay?

My career choice?
You think that I moved out here to be a blood boy?
Did you know I have a degree on CS?

You do?

Yeah, you probably thought that I was just, you know, some dumb jock（运动员）.
well, that's typical, because people who look like me,
we never get taken seriously in the tech business by people who look like you.
you're biased.

Hang on, I'm not biased. Okay?

Come on! The whole business is biased!
I mean, that's the only way that a good-looking guy like me could get in a room with Gavin Belson,
is by being a blood boy!
And that sucks. I-- I got to work out constantly.
I can't have a beer with my friends,. I can't eat junk food.
Do you know that Gavin made me go full veg?
I mean, fuck soy, man!
But to people like you, I'm just a beautiful bag of blood.
but you know what, I got some pretty good fucking ideas, and Gavin actually listens to those ideas.
It took a while, but he respects me.
And you know what? Richard Hendricks?
You clearly fucking don't. so good night.
