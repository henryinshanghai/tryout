Hey

Hey

Yeah. I was walking around your hood,
and I thought I'd swing by, and we could talk about tech, you know, cause we both know so much about it.

Cool.

Oh, man. I-- I-- I don't know if you know this, but your eyes are super red right now.

Oh, yeah? Yeah, I have `allergies.

Really? this time of year?

What-- what're you doing?

Oh, just-- just hanging, man. Why? You paranoid?

Paranoid? No

You know, Bryce, I got to be honest, I'm a little hungry. Do you have anything to eat?

Just some creatine(肌酸), protein powder, soy extract（大豆提取物）.

Well, I'm kind of looking for something a little bit more sweet.
Oh, Bryce!

that-- that's not mine. that's for my guests. My-- my fat guests.

you know, the fella who owns the house I live in, he buys food like this,
because when he uses the products he buys at the very same health food store you go to, he get carvings...
for food just like this.
and this stuff is not good for your blood.
Geary Street Organics isn't a food store, is it? It's a pot dispensary. Isn't it?
I got you, Bryce! You fucking liar!
You said you had a degree in CS. Well, bullshit. I checked.
it's not computer science. it's Calis`thenic(体操) Studies.
What? What?
You listen to me, you muscle-bound, handsome Adonis（阿多尼斯 希腊神话中的美少男）.
Tech is reserved for people like me, Okay?
The freaks, the weirdos, the misfits, the geeks, the dweebs, the dorks! Not you.
Oh, and your days of leeching off（吸血） Gavin Belson are over.
Game over, blood boy.

you funckin' nerd.
