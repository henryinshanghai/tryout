to 'generate json documentation':
    add the springfox-swagger dependency.

to 'generate human readable and interactive html documentation':
    add the springfox-swagger-ui dependency

to enable swagger in spring boot
    add @EnableSwagger2 at some class in spring boot

to get the documentation that springfox provided:
    /v2/api-docs // JSON documentation
    /swagger-ui.html // human readable documentation

to tailor what the documentation display:
    - sharp off the unnecessary endpoints:
        create a docket instance, and add in the restrictions.

    - adding application metadata
        still add this in docket instance
        refer apiInfo() method

to setup more specific information on apis:
    adding details to APIs using annotations;
    - annotations on controller
    - annotations on entity

    there's way much annotations for information, make the code have loads noises.
