lived my life alone 独自一人生活

Something was broken in... 内部有损伤

had with me neither.. nor.. 身边既没有..也没有...

set myself to... 开始着手做...

a question of life or death 事关生死的问题

jumped to my feet 跳起身来

completely thunderstruck 呆若木鸡

looked carefully all around me 环顾四周

examining me with great seriousness 仔细审视我

boas from the outside and boa from the inside 从外部与从内部

straying uncertainly 漫无目的地游荡

fainting from fatigue 因为饥饿而头脑发昏

what are you doing here 你搁这儿干啥呢？

greet it with... 迎接，问候，评价...

over once more 再一次

my patience was exhausted 耐心用尽

in a hurry to do... 着急要做...

taking my engine apart 拆开引擎

tossed off 丢出

threw out 丢出

a light break over the face of... 脸上露出了放松的表情?

a great deal of... 很多的...

surely be enough 肯定够了

bent his head over 把头埋进...

made the acquaintance of... 结识...
