描述过去👇
Once when I WAS six years old I SAW a magnificent picture in a book,
called True Stories from Nature, about the pri'meval forest.
It WAS a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.


The grow-ups' response, this time, WAS to advise me to LAY ASIDE my drawings of boa constrictors,
whether from the inside or the outside, and DEVOTE myself instead to
geography, history, arithmetic and grammar.


情态动词 + 动词原形：对现在或将来的可能 - might be
情态动词之后 只能接动词原形，所以怎么表示过去的猜测呢？ 答：情态动词 + have + 过去分词
表示对过去的可能：情态动词 + 动词原形
That is why, at the age of six, I GAVE UP what might have been（对过去的可能性的推测）
a magnificent career as a painter.

描述过去做过的一些事 👇 手段：现在完成时
I HAVE FLOWN a little over all parts of the world;
and it is true that geography HAS BEEN（强调过去和现在都是一样的状态 - 手段：现在完成时） very useful to me.
At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona.

???
In the course of this life I have had（描述过去做过的一些事） a great many encounters
with a great many people who have been（从过去到现在持续一段时间 / 一直） concerned（担心的） with matters of consequence.

I have lived a great deal among grow-ups.
I have seen them intimately, close at hand.
And that hasn't much improved（强调 过去持续到现在，都没有改变 但将来可能改变） my opinion of them.

现在完成时：
#1 过去到现在，持续一种状态；
#2 过去做过，但没有提供具体时间；

一般过去时：过去具体的时间（小学）；
我小学时读过这本书；I read this book in my primary school.
我读过这本书；I have read this book before. (曾经不是具体的时间)
