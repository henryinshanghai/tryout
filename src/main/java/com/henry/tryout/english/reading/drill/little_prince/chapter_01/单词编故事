what the nature strike me the most is that
its magnificent scale, and its delicate details.
you can find a boa constrictor in a primeval forest,
how it can eat an elephant and use the whole month to do the digestion.

you can also ponder so many knowledge that human-made, like
literature masterpiece, geography, arithmetic, and grammar.

while young age may make it easy for you to be disheartened
when u deal with all that.
it is important for you to have the witness to distinguish
of what contains the matter of consequence from what's not.

remember, at your youth, it's always great to do experiment.
because before you realise it, you'd become a worker of politics,
wearing an ugly necktie, and meet whoever the fat guy it.

it is sensible to make a complain, after all,
you and only you should be the one who concerned about your life,
every single minutes of it.
