过去发生的具体动作 - 一般过去时 👇
🐖 在给出了 过去的具体时间点时，只能使用过去式语法
So I LIVED my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to,
until I HAD an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago.

为什么这里 to后面是动词原形 attempt呢？
I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone.


为什么这里 使用的是 动词的ing形式 examining呢？
And I SAW a most extraordinary small person,
who STOOD there examining me with great seriousness.

这里为什么使用 had crashed? 这是什么语法结构？具体什么作用？
Remember, I HAD CRASHED in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region.


这里为什么使用 had been concerned? 这是什么语法结构？具体什么作用？
But then I remembered how my studies HAD BEEN CONCERNED on geography...

But I HAD NEVER DRAWN a sheep.
