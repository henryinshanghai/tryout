This is a Boeing factory in the US state of South Carolina.

Workers here in Charleston are assembling（聚集） the company’s flagship（旗舰） product;
The 787 Dreamliner.

But this footage（视频片段） reveals some have little faith in the plane they build.
Of 15 workers asked randomly, 10 said they would not fly on the Dreamliner.

An employee captured the footage（视频片段） after contacting Al Jazeera to tell us he had serious concerns about what he was seeing.

At his request（请求）, we changed his voice.
With all the problems reported on the 787
There’s 90% that’s getting swept away（扫到一边）, hushed up（被噤声了）.
It’s an iceberg（冰山一角）.

In another meeting, the source（线人） told us workers are often under-skilled（训练不足的）, uncaring（漠不关心的）,
and in some cases, on drugs（使用毒品）.

I’ve seen a lot of things that should not go on at an airplane plant.
People talking about doing drugs, looking for drugs.
