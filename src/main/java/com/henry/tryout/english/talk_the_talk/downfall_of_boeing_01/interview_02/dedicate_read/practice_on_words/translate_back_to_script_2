This is a Boeing factory in China of Shanghai.

Workers [here]+ in PuDong are assembling the company's flagship product. the 787 Dreamliner.

But this footage reveals that some have little faith on[in]+ the plane they build.
Of 15 workers asked randomly, 10 said they would not fly on the Dreamliner.

An employee captured this footage after contacting ShangHai Evening News to tell us he had serious concerns about what he was seeing.

At his request, we changed his voice.

[with all the]+ Problems reported on 787,
there's 90% [of them]- [that's]+ getting swept away, hushed up.
It's an iceberg.

in another meeting, the source told us that workers [are]+ often under-skilled, uncaring, in some cases, on drugs.

I saw a lot of things that should not go on in[at]~ an airplane plant,
people [are]- talking about doing drugs, looking for drugs.
