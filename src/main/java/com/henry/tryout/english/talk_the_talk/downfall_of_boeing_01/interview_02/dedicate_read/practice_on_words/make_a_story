the flagship of my company is loan, y'know, it'll take away your umbrella when its raining.
if you try to capture a footage of how it works, you gotta have faith in the mechanism.

the clean lady would sweep away all the items on the work station,
and I'll hush up these talking ladies when I'm having my noon snap.
you see these codes on this screen, and how bad that is. it's an iceberg.

and these employees with four eyes working on these stations, they're hard worker indeed.
but they're all under-skilled, and they're uncaring. they're probably on drugs.

it's a freaking mess.
