- Model Answer

The recent advances in AI has the potential to improve `human capabilities`.
On one hand, `humanoids` equipped with `mobile` and `dextrous` abilities can assist humans in areas
where manual labor is required, alleviating the `labor crisis` we are currently facing.
This can free up humans from mundane tasks and allow them to focus on more fullfilling work.
最近人工智能的进步有可能提高`人类能力`。一方面，装备了`移动`和`灵巧`能力的`仿生人`可以在需要手工劳动的领域协助人类，缓解我们目前面临的`劳动力危机`。这可以使人类从日常琐事中解放出来，让他们专注于更有成就感的工作。

However, to say that AI is purely good couldn’t be `further from the truth`.
There are terrifying risks associated with AI, especially if we continue to `push the envelope`
without regard to the ethical implications.
The potential loss of jobs due to automation could exacerbate（） economic inequalities（）
and disrupt（） entire industries.

然而，说人工智能纯粹是好事`与事实大相径庭`。与人工智能相关的风险令人恐惧，特别是如果我们继续`挑战极限`而不考虑伦理含义的话。自动化可能导致的工作岗位损失可能会加剧经济不平等并破坏整个行业。

Going down `the rabbit hole` of AI
without a clear plan for the `long haul`
could lead to unforeseen consequences.
It is important to `get one’s hands dirty` by engaging with AI technology responsibly and critically,
understanding its impact on society as a whole.

没有一个明确的长期计划，就盲目深入人工智能的`兔子洞`可能会导致无法预见的后果。
重要的是要通过负责任和批判性地参与人工智能技术，`亲自动手`理解其对整个社会的影响。

In conclusion, while AI holds great promise, a balanced approach is necessary
to ensure that its development and implementation truly benefit humanity in the long term.

总之，虽然人工智能拥有巨大的潜力，但采取平衡的方法来确保其发展和实施真正从长远来看惠及人类是必要的。
