This is Boeing factory in China, shanghai.

workers here in PuDong are assembling(组装) the company's flagship product（旗舰产品）: the 787 Dreamliner.

but this video reveals（揭示了） that some have little faith on the product they build.
out of 15 workers asked randomly（随机访问）, 10 said they would not fly on the Dreamliner.

an employee captured this footage（拍摄了视频） after contacting ShangHai Evening Paper saying his serious concerns about what he saw.

At his request(应他要求), we changed his voice.

all the problems been reported, 90% of them has been sweeped away（扫走）, hushed up（噤声）.
it's an iceberg.

on another meeting, the source tell us that workers usually under-skilled（培训不足）, uncaring（漠不关心）,
and sometimes, on drugs（吸毒状态）.

I saw a lot of things that should not happened in a plane plant,
people are talking about doing drugs and getting drugs.
