Vittorio:

love this!
but why did you give it the voice of a 50yo smoker?

喜欢这个！
但你为什么给它一个 50 岁烟民的声音呢？

I’m in school for mechanical engineering right now. The work you and many others do at Figure is what inspires me to open my textbooks each morning.
Thank you,
-Daniel

我现在正在学习机械工程。你和Figure其他人的工作激励我每天早上都翻开课本。
谢谢你。

Cool. But, don't try to hide they will be taking peoples jobs.
If companies have jobs that cannot be filled, it means they aren't offering the market rate. Really basic and not hard to figure out.

很酷。但是，不要试图隐瞒他们将抢走人们的工作。
如果公司有无法填补的职位，则意味着他们没有提供市场价格。非常基础而且不难理解。

It’s one of the first robots,
and humans are already gaslighting it with that apple and trash.
No wonder they might all turn against us in the end .

它是第一批机器人之一，而人类已经用苹果和垃圾来欺骗它。难怪它们最终可能会背叛我们。

The pause in between decision making gives me hope that
we have at least 6-8 seconds between each decision to run
before it decides to kill us.

决策之间的停顿给了我希望，在每个决策之间至少有 6-8 秒的时间来运行，然后它才会决定杀死我们。
