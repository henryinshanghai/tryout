Have you ever felt some kind
of emptiness inside
you will never measure up, to those people you
must be strong, can't show them that you're weak.

你是否曾经感觉内心空虚到难以言表，
而对于一些人，你必须表现得坚强，不能够向他们展示你的脆弱。

Have you ever told someone
something that's far from the truth
Let them know that you're okay
just to make them stop.
all the wondering, and questions they may have.

你是否曾经告诉某个人一些远非事实的话，
好让他们知道你状态很好，这样他们才会停下。
他们所有可能的疑惑与问题。

I'm okay, I really am now,
just needed some time, to figure things out.
Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you,
still we don't know, what's yet to come.

我很好，现在真的是这样。
只是需要一些时间，来弄清楚一些事情。
我没撒谎，我会一直和你保持诚实。
只是我们仍旧不知道，未来会发生些什么。
