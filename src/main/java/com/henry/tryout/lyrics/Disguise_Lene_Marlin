Have you ever felt some kind
of emptiness inside
you will never measure up, to those people you
must be strong, can't show them that you're weak.

Have you ever told someone
something that's far from the truth
Let them know that you're okay
just to make them stop.
all the wondering, and questions they may have.

I'm okay, I really am now,
just needed some time, to figure things out.
Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you,
still we don't know, what's yet to come.
