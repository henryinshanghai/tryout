when you try your best but you don't succeed.
when you get what you want but not what you need.
when you feel so tired but you can't sleep.
stuck in reverse.

当你竭尽全力但却没能成功，
当你得到你想要的东西 却发现并非所需
当你感到如此疲惫 但却无法入睡
生命好像陷入了循环之中

when the tears come streaming down your face.
when you lose something you can't replace.
when you love someone but it goes to waste.
could it be worse?

当眼泪沿着脸颊滑落，
当你丢掉了你无法替换的东西
当你爱上一个人但是却无果而终
这一切还能更糟糕吗？

Lights will guide you home,
and ignite your bones,
and I will try to fix you.

星光会引领你回家，
并且点燃你的勇气，
而我会尝试拯救你。

and high up above or down below,
when you're too in love to let it go.
but if you never try, you'll never know.
just what you're worth.

不管是高峰还是低谷，
当你深陷爱情而无法决断。
但如果你从不尝试的话，你永远都不会知道，
你到底值得些什么。
