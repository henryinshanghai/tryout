Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry

For even if I'm far away,
I hold you in my heart.

I sing a secret song to you,
Each night we are apart.

Remember me,
Each time you hear a sad guitar.
Know that I'm with you.

The only way that I can be
Until you're in my arms again.
Remember me

If you close your eyes and let the music play,
Keep our love alive, I'll never fade away.
If you close your eyes and let the music play.
Keep our love alive, I'll never fade away.

Remember me,
And let the love we have live on,
The only way that I can be,
So, until you're my arms again
