Am I blue?
Am I blue?
Ain't these tears in my eyes telling you

Am I blue, you'd be too.
If each plan with your man
done fell through.

Was a time I was his only one,
but now I'm the sad and lonely one.
Oh yes, I am. Was I gay, till today.

Now he's gone and we're through.
Am I blue.

Was a time I was his only one,
but now I'm the sad and lonely one.
Oh yes, I am/was gay, till today.
