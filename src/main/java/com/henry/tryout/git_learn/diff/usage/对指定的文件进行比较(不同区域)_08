By default, Git will include changes to all available files in the diff output.

If you want to diff(找出相异点) only a few files at a time,
then use the -- <paths> argument.

All of the different flavors（风味） of git diff support filtering files like this:
$ git diff -- myfile.txt

You can pass multiple files at a time.
The example above will only display changes (if any) present in the myfile.txt file.
