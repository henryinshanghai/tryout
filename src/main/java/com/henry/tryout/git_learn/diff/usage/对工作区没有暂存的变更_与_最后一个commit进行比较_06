$ git diff
You can think of this as the git diff default form.
Usually it is run with the simple command "git diff" and no options.
This use case only shows
local changes that you made in your repo since the last commit (Git HEAD),
that have not been staged.
After you have staged all of your changes, git diff will return no output.


When a branch name, commit ID, other ref, or filename
is not specified in the git diff command,
Git will default to
comparing your changes to the HEAD commit (currently checked out commit).
