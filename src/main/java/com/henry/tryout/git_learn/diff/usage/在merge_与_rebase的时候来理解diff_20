When merging or rebasing in Git, you may have noticed references（引用名称） to "ours" and "theirs".
When merging, "ours" refers to the currently checked out branch（当前分支）,
and "theirs" refers to the branch you are merging from(所要合并的改动 所在的源头分支):
$ git checkout merge-into-ours（当前分支）
$ git merge from-theirs （所要合并的改动 所在的源头分支）

When rebasing in Git, they are flipped（反转）.
The "ours" keyword refers to an anonymous branch(匿名的分支)
that holds the result of the rebase so far（包含当前的变基结果）,
and "theirs" refers to the original branch being rebased(被变基的原始分支).

变基：把他们的commits 添加到 我们的当前分支上；

You can run these commands in the middle of a merge or rebase
to help orient yourself with（使你了解） respect to the changes being made:
$ git diff --ours
$ git diff --theirs
$ git diff --base
