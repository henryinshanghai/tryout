Git's diff algorithm can be used to check(检查) the results of a merge commit:

$ git diff <merge-commit> <parent-commit>
In this example, the first commit argument
must be the commit ID of the merge commit.
Subsequent(随后的) commit arguments
refer to the list of parent commits.

The list of parent commits can be automatically generated using ^@ syntax:
git diff master master^@

This is equivalent to "git show master"[extend].
