There are many different ways
you can Git diff for comparison（比较变化） purposes,
such as：
#1 comparing (known as diffing) local unstaged changes（尚未暂存的变更） to the previous commit（上一次commit）,
#2 comparing staged changes（已经暂存的变更） to the previous commit（上一次commit）,
#3 comparing any two files（任意的两个文件） on our machine, and more.

Let's go through some of these examples now.
