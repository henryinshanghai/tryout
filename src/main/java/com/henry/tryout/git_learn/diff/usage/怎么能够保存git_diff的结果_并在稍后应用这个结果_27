The diff output（diff命令的输出结果） is also called a patch(补丁).
It can be used as input to other Git commands
to actually apply those changes.
This is called applying a patch（应用一个补丁） in Git.

To save a patch from git diff, run one of the following:
$ git diff > myfile.patch
$ git format-patch -k --stdout HEAD^1..HEAD > myfile.mbox

If the patch was generated
using git diff or the Unix diff command,
then it can be applied
using git apply myfile.patch.
This will make changes to the working directory.
The command is transactional（具有事务性的）, meaning it will either apply completely or abort.

If the patch was generated
using the "git format-patch" command,
then your job is easier
because the patch already contains the commit author and commit message information.
Apply the patch
using the "git am" command.
This command is able to automatically create commits
instead of just changing the working directory(更新工作目录).

As an aside（题外话）,
the "git am" command is built
to read an mbox（电子邮件格式） file,
which is a simple, plain-text format
for storing one or more email messages in one text file.
This is one possible way to collaborate with git over（使用） email,
rather than using git on a server.
