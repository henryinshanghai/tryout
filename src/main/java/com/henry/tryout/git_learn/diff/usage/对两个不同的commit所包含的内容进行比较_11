$ git diff <commit1> <commit2>
Compare changes between two arbitrary(任意的) commits.
They don't have to belong to the same branch.

$ git diff test
As opposed to（不同于） comparing the tip of the current branch（当前分支）,
you may compare a branch to the tip of a "test" branch（另一个分支） using “Git diff test”.

$ git diff HEAD^ HEAD
You can compare the last commit（最后一个commit）
to the version before the last commit
using git diff head.
