The text output（文本输出） of a diff can be hard to read.
Many graphical or external diff viewing programs exist
to make life easier
by displaying diffs side by side（并排）.

Common programs used are
Sublime Text, Eclipse, VSCode, p4merge, Intellij, and Beyond Compare.

Simply run "git difftool" instead of git diff
to open an external viewing program(外部的用于查看的程序) of your choice.

Run "git difftool --tool-help" to see what is available on your system.

To configure an external diff tool run "git config --global diff.external <executable name>".
You may need to wrap the executable in a shell script
to get the arguments to be passed correctly.
Git passes 7 arguments to the external git tool,
but you usually only need arguments number 2 and 5 (old file and new file).


Environment variables:
GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is used
as an override(覆写)
for the "diff.external" configuration value.
If it’s set, Git will invoke this program when git diff is invoked.
