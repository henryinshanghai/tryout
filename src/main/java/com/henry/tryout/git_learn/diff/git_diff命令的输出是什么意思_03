The git diff command outputs
a text based representation
known as the unified format.

Here is an example of the git diff default usage and output:
$ git diff
结果参考： attachment/diff_output_demo.txt

The output structure is easily explained,
but can be tricky to fully grasp.
Note that the following sections may refer to "left" and "right" versions.
You can think of this as essentially being the previous and current version.

The output may be broken down into the following sections: (3)
#1 Comparison input (header)
Displays the left and right files (prefixed with a and b) and the left and right commit hashes

#2 Sections
   Section header
       #1 Set off by（用...分隔开） @@ symbol (@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@)
       #2 The left and right files are denoted by - and + (@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@)
       #3 Section start line number（行数） for both versions
        are the first number（第一个数字） in each comma delimeted pair（由逗号分隔的对子） (@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@)
       #4 Section length for both versions（长度） is the second number (@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@)

   Changes
       #1 Lines only in the left version（仅仅存在于左边的版本中的行） start with -
       #2 lines only in the right version（仅仅存在于右边的版本中的行） start with +
       #3 Lines in both versions start（在两边版本中都存在的行） with a space
       #4 You can control the number of context lines
        with git diff -UN, where N is the number of lines
