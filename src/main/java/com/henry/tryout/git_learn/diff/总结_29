In this article, we discussed the git diff command,
how it works,
how to use it to track(追踪) changes in data,
and a variety of different scenarios to apply it.

You can use git diff
at any point in the git life cycle
to track changes in files（文件）, working directories（工作目录）, committed changes（commit）, and more.
