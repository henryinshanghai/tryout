By default, git diff command options
will display the unified（统一的） diff format between two commits.

The combined(组合的) diff format
shows two or more user-specified files（开发者指定的多个文件） with one file（某一个文件）
and shows how that file is different from each of the specified files.
You can use the -c or --cc option to produce a combined diff.
