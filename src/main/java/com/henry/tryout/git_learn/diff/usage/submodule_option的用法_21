The git diff --submodule flag can be used to
show what actually changed in a submodule,
instead of merely indicating that something changed.
$ git diff --submodule

If you don't want to type --submodule every time you run git diff,
you can set it as the default format
by setting the diff.submodule config value to "log":
$ git config diff.submodule log

Another way to accomplish this is
with the submodule foreach command:
$ git submodule foreach 'git diff'
