By default, running git format-patch
will generate a patch for each commit
starting with the specified commit, and ending with the currently checked-out commit.

One patch is generated per commit
based on the diff between each commit and its parent.

Note that patches are not generated for merge commits,
so ideally you should
rebase your feature into a single line of history
to generate a clean set of patches.

As mentioned, one .patch file is generated for each commit
in your patch series.
