Git patch format

Git creates each patch
in a new file with a .patch extension in your current directory.

Git patches have the following format: demo.patch

This may look a bit complicated, but really it is just a way for Git
to understand the following information directly from the patch itself:

#1 The commit id that the patch was derived from:
From 21e6b1b3700970fdc2382e01d6da723e51b007b5 ...

#2 The commit author and email (sender of the email patch):
From: Jacob Stopak <jacob@initialcommit.io>

#3 The date the patch was generated:
Date: Thu, 20 Oct 2022 22:12:00 -0700

#4 The subject line of the email, which is set to [PATCH] followed by the commit message:
Subject: [PATCH] Update filename

#5 A diffstat representing the changes between the commit and its parent:
---
 filename | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

diff --git a/filename b/filename
index 01a9f34..b9022e5 100644
--- a/nf
+++ b/nf
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 asdf

#6 The Git version that was used to generate the patch:
2.38.0

When this patch is sent to another developer over email,
they can use Git on their end
to reconstruct the commit
and apply to a branch in their repository.
