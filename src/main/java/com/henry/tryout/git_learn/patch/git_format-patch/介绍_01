Most development teams sync commits directly between their local and remote repositories
using the git push and git pull commands.

When using these commands, Git uses either the SSH or HTTPS protocol
to perform data transfers between the two endpoints.

However, some project maintainers
- including major open source projects such as Linux and Git itself
- prefer to work via email instead.

Git has a set of subcommands that
are specifically designed for distributed collaboration via email(通过email 进行分布式合作).

For commits to be relayed（接力、传递） effectively over email,
they need to be formatted as text entities in a standardized format.
The git format-patch command assists with this process.

In this article, we explain
how to use the git format-patch command
to prepare one or more commits
to be transferred by email.
