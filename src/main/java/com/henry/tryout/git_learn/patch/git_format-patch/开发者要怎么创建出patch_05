How to create a Git patch?

Creating a patch is a simple as
running git format-patch <commit> in your local Git repo.

You can specify the commit
using it's commit id, any branch or tag name,
or a variation of Git HEAD such as HEAD^ for the previous commit.

After running the command, you'll see one or more .patch files
generated in your current directory
containing the patch data.

The file names are prefixed with a 4-digit number
indicating their order in the patch series,
followed by a hyphen-separated string
created using the commit message.

For the format used above, this would be:
0001-Update-nf-again.patch
