Another way to generate multiple patches is to
specify a range of revisions, as follows:

$ git format-patch <commit1>..<commit2>

This will create patches for all commits
between <commit1> and <commit2>.

See Git's documentation on "specifying revision ranges"
for more examples of valid revision range syntax.
