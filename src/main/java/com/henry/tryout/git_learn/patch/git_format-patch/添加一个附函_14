In addition to creating your patches,
you can generate a "Git cover letter"
which you can email as an overarching(包罗一切的) summary of your patch series.

The cover letter is also a .patch file
created with filename 0000-cover-letter.patch by default.

It contains the following information:

#1 Custom description of the patch series
#2 The git shortlog output
#3 The full patch series diffstat
#4 The Git version used to generate the cover letter

Here is an example cover letter,
for which you can fill in the fields with asterisks（星号）:

$ git format-patch --cover-letter HEAD~2
0000-cover-letter.patch
0001-Revert-Revert-Add-qwer.patch
0002-Revert-Add-qwer.patch

$ cat 0000-cover-letter.patch
