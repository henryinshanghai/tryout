You can format Git patches for one commit at a time, or for multiple commits at once.

We'll start with formatting patches for multiple commits
since that is a more common scenario.

--- Git-Format Patch(格式化打包) Multiple Commits ---
By default, when you run the standard “git format-patch <commit>”,
a patch will be created for each commit
starting at the one you specified with <commit>,
up until the current HEAD is reached.

Therefore, you'll usually end up with more than 1 patch being created,
unless you start generating at HEAD^ (aka HEAD~1),
which is the commit previous to the currently checked out HEAD.

Note that this means no patches will be created
for commits previous to the <commit> that you specified.

Alternatively, you can use the --root flag to instead
create patches for all commits
from beginning or your commit history,
up until the specified <commit>.
