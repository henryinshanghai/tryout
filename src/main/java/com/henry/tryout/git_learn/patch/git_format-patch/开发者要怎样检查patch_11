You can see your patch files in your current directory
by running the ls command in Linux or MacOS.
In Windows you can use the dir command.

Alternatively, you can see your patches listed in your file explorer(文件管理器) in any operating system.

Keep in mind that
if you are generating a long patch series with many patches,
you may want to put them in their own subdirectory（生成到一个子目录中） using the -o option:

$ git format-patch -o <new-feature-subdirectory> <commit>
The specified subdirectory will be created if it doesn't yet exist.

This can be useful for
grouping together（汇集） patches related to a specific feature,
so you can make sure to only mail out those patches together and no others by accident（无意地）.
