You might notice that
if you try to run git format-patch on its own
or git format-patch HEAD, you won't get any output and no patch will be created.

That's because
there are no differences
between the specified patch (HEAD)
and the current commit (which is also HEAD).

So you are confused by this, just realize you need to
specify a commit earlier on in the branch history.
