Earlier in this post, we showed a sample format for a email patch in Git.
Let's expand on that.
You can think of each patch file as being a message
- and it really is since it's meant to be emailed as a message to another dev.


This message
starts with an email header that includes the "From:", "Date:", and "Subject:" fields.
Note that the subject field
contains the first line from the commit message of the corresponding commit.

Next comes
the remaining lines (if there are any) of the commit message.

Our example format above does not include more lines in the commit log message.

After this, there is a 3-hyphen delimiter,
separating the commit message from the patch content itself.

Lastly, we have the actual diffstat output,
which represents the meat(核心内容) of the patch.

This is actually the output of the “diff -p --stat” command.
Feel free to check out our git diff article for more details.
